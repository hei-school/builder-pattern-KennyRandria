 **# Builder Pattern Example : CAR with JavaScript**

##  Crafting Cars Step-by-Step

This project showcases the Builder design pattern in JavaScript, a powerful tool for constructing complex objects like cars and their manuals in a flexible and controlled manner.

##  Project Structure

Here's a roadmap to navigate our code:

- **src/:** The hub for all our JavaScript source files.
- **Main.js:** The main entry point, where the testing magic happens.
- **Car.js:** Defines the blueprint for a car, outlining its features.
- **Manual.js:** Encapsulates the structure of a car manual, ready to guide drivers.
- **Engine.js:** Models the heart of a car, providing power and performance.
- **CarBuilder.js:** Implements the Builder interface, crafting cars step-by-step.
- **Director.js:** The conductor of the building process, orchestrating each step.

##  How to Run

1. **Install Node.js:** Ensure Node.js is set up on your system to execute JavaScript code.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Bring this project to your local machine using `git clone`.
3. **Open in Your Favorite Editor:** Explore the code in your preferred Visual Studio Code or IDE.
4. **Run the Application:** In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and execute `node main.js` to witness the Builder pattern in action.


Embrace the Builder pattern for a smoother ride in your JavaScript development journey!
